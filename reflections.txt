How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent one week and 1 day working on this project. Approximately 3 hours per day.
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I would say the most rewarding challenge was getting a hang of how initialise method works and structuring my code after lessons on Class are introducted. 
What two additional features did you build? Why?
Where do you still have room to grow?
Plenty. I feel that I need to do many more projects in order to get familiar with coding in Ruby and creation of new methods. Also, there are so many methods existing in Ruby which I have not try yet and I feel like I am only scratching the surface so far.
